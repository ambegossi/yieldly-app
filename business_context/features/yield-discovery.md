### Protocol Information
- **Yield Source:** Clear identification of lending protocol (Aave, Compound, Curve)
- **Network Display:** Blockchain network (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum) with gas cost estimates  
- **Safety Indicators:** Risk level (Low/Medium/High) based on protocol maturity and audits
- **Historical Context:** 7-day and 30-day yield trends for each protocol

## User Experience Design

### First-Time Users
- **Guided Tutorial:** 3-step walkthrough explaining APY, protocols, and risk levels
- **Safe Defaults:** Conservative protocols highlighted for newcomers
- **Educational Tooltips:** Hover/tap explanations for technical terms
- **Success Stories:** "Users like you earn 5.2% vs 0.1% on exchanges"

### Returning Users  
- **Personalized View:** Previously viewed protocols and favorites prioritized
- **Change Notifications:** Push alerts when favorite protocols change rates significantly
- **Quick Actions:** One-tap access to external protocol links
- **Performance Tracking:** Portfolio-level view of all yields being earned

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Primary:** DeFiLlama API for comprehensive protocol coverage
- **Secondary:** CoinGecko API for redundancy and validation
- **Tertiary:** Direct protocol APIs for highest accuracy
- **Validation:** Cross-reference minimum 2 sources before display

### Performance Requirements
- **Load Time:** <2 seconds for main dashboard on 4G connection
- **Refresh Rate:** Real-time updates every 15 minutes, manual refresh available
- **Offline Mode:** Cached data available for 24 hours without internet
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable

## Usage Patterns & Analytics

### High-Performing Features
- **Best APY Sorting:** 85% of users sort by highest yield first
- **Risk Filtering:** 60% of new users filter to "Low Risk" only
- **Protocol Details:** Average 45-second time spent reading protocol information
- **External Links:** 25% click-through rate to actual protocols

### Common User Flows
1. **Discovery:** Open app → View highest yields → Read protocol details → External visit
2. **Monitoring:** Open app → Check favorites → Compare to alternatives → Set alerts
3. **Research:** Search specific protocol → Compare networks → Analyze historical trends

### Success Indicators
- **Engagement:** 3+ protocol comparisons per session
- **Retention:** 40%+ users return within 48 hours
- **Conversion:** 15%+ click through to external protocols
- **Satisfaction:** 4.5+ rating for "helped me find better yields"

## Common Issues & Limitations

### Data Accuracy Challenges
- **API Delays:** Some protocols update rates with 1-2 hour delays
- **Network Variations:** Gas costs can significantly impact effective yield
- **Temporary Spikes:** Brief high APYs may not reflect sustainable rates
- **Pool Capacity:** High yields may have limited deposit capacity

### User Understanding Issues
- **Risk Misperception:** High APYs may be viewed as risk-free
- **Gas Cost Confusion:** Users may not factor transaction costs into yield calculations
- **Impermanent Loss:** Limited understanding of LP token risks
- **Lock-up Periods:** Some yields require locked deposits not clearly indicated

### Technical Limitations
- **Real-time Accuracy:** 15-minute refresh may miss rapid rate changes
- **Protocol Coverage:** Cannot include every new or niche protocol instantly
- **Network Congestion:** Performance degrades during high market volatility
- **Mobile Constraints:** Complex protocol information challenging on small screens

## AI Interaction Guidelines

### User Questions & Responses
**"What's the safest high yield option?"**
- Recommend established protocols (Aave, Compound) with 6+ month track records
- Explain that "safe" in DeFi is relative - compare to traditional finance risks
- Suggest diversification across 2-3 protocols rather than concentration

**"Why is this APY different from the protocol website?"**  
- Explain 15-minute refresh intervals and potential timing differences
- Acknowledge data source limitations and multiple API dependencies
- Direct to protocol website for most current rates before investing

**"Should I move all my stablecoins to the highest yield?"**
- Recommend diversification across protocols and networks
- Explain impermanent loss and smart contract risks
- Suggest starting with smaller amounts to test protocols

### Educational Opportunities
- **Protocol Maturity:** Explain how protocol age and TVL impact safety
- **Network Differences:** Help users understand L1 vs L2 trade-offs (security vs cost)
- **Yield Sustainability:** Discuss temporary vs sustainable yield sources
- **Risk Management:** Promote portfolio diversification principles

### Escalation Triggers
- Questions about specific investment advice (regulatory compliance)
- Technical issues with data accuracy or app performance
- Requests for protocols not yet supported on platform
- Complex DeFi strategies beyond basic yield farming
