**Financial Health (25 points)**
- Total Value Locked (TVL): >$100M (25pts), $10-100M (20pts), <$10M (15pts)
- Liquidity depth: Deep liquidity across multiple assets (25pts), moderate liquidity (15pts)
- Yield sustainability: Conservative yield models (25pts), aggressive models (10pts)

**Governance & Decentralization (20 points)**
- Governance model: Decentralized DAO (20pts), multi-sig control (15pts), centralized (10pts)
- Token distribution: Fair distribution (20pts), concentrated holdings (10pts)
- Upgrade mechanisms: Timelock controls (20pts), immediate upgrades (5pts)

### Risk Level Classifications
- **Low Risk (80-100 points):** Established protocols like Aave, Compound with 2+ year track records
- **Medium Risk (60-79 points):** Newer protocols with good fundamentals but limited history  
- **High Risk (40-59 points):** Experimental protocols or those with known issues
- **Very High Risk (<40 points):** New launches, unaudited protocols, concerning metrics
