## Strategic Trade-offs & Decisions

**Decision:** Focus on stablecoin yields deeply before expanding to other assets
**Rationale:** Build expertise and trust in lower-risk category first, establish safety reputation

**Trade-off:** May lose some advanced users to more comprehensive tools

### Mobile vs Web
**Decision:** Mobile-first development with web parity
**Rationale:** Differentiation from desktop-heavy competitors, modern user expectations
**Trade-off:** Some complex features may be challenging on mobile interfaces
