# Specification Quality Checklist: Home Screen - Stablecoin Yield Comparison

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the next phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1, P2, P3)
- Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-021)
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Well-defined edge cases covering error states, network issues, and user interactions
- Clear scope boundaries with detailed "Out of Scope" section
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous

**Notes**:
- Specification successfully avoids implementation details while providing clear functional guidance
- Filter functionality is well-specified with multi-select support and combined filtering
- Responsive design requirements reference the provided design mockups
- Edge cases appropriately address real-world scenarios (network failures, empty states, orientation changes)
